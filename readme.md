Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
Hi! My name is Antonio Escuchas 'AKA' Vortex080, junior developer and content creator on @Twitch.

I love learning new things and creating projects that people can enjoy, that's why I started my career creating game servers using my own scripts. Also, for years I've been acquiring knowledge together with my community on Twitch.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on @citizenfx and @altmp projects.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TypeScript, Angular, Dart and more
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Lua, Java, HTML, CSS, JS, SQL...
âš¡ More about me: Like many I love playing video games, I have even led large communities of various games although the highlight in recent years was the creation of content on Twitch, including collaboration on several series of famous content creators.
